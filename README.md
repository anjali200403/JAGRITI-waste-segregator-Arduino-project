# JAGRITI
JAGRITI stands for **J**ust **A** **G**reen  **R**esourceful **I**ntelligent **T**rash **I**nterface. It is a project focused on managing waste in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner. 
The main aim is to create an automated waste segregation system using Arduino. The system identifies and sorts waste into different categories based on predefined parameters.

## Overview

The project uses sensors and actuators controlled by an Arduino board to detect and segregate waste into categories such as organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable. It involves the following components:

- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic Sensor, Moisture Sensor and IR Sensor.
- **Actuators:** Servo motors.
- **Arduino Uno Board:** Utilized for processing sensor data and controlling actuators based on defined logic.

## Implementation

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect Sensors:** Wire and mount sensors to detect different waste types.
2. **Configure Actuators:** Connect actuators to the Arduino board for waste segregation.
3. **Arduino Board Setup:** Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository to the Arduino board.

**Circuit design of the model is given along with the code**


### Usage

1. Power on the Arduino board and the connected components.
2. Place waste items within the detection range of the sensors.
3. The system will process the sensor data and segregate the waste into respective categories.
